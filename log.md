# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 01 August 2018

**Today's Progress**: Decided to persue Javascript and build my knowledge in Python. Ordered Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set by Jon Duckett and started the JS and Python courses by Codeacademy. By the end of my 100 days, I would like to be able to:

1.) Quickly deploy a website (www.adamrunion.com) using Flask and Python.
2.) Manipulate the website using Javascript in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
3.) Maintain the website under reasonable circumstances.

**Thoughts:** HTML and CSS may have the largest learning curve seeing as how I already know bits of Python and JS. I stopped coding sites before HTML 5 was released and I never picked it back up until now.
