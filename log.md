# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 01 August 2018

**Today's Progress**: Decided to persue Javascript and build my knowledge in Python. Ordered Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set by Jon Duckett and started the JS and Python courses by Codeacademy. By the end of my 100 days, I would like to be able to:

1.) Quickly deploy a website (www.adamrunion.com) using Flask and Python.
2.) Manipulate the website using Javascript in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
3.) Maintain the website under reasonable circumstances.

**Thoughts:** HTML and CSS may have the largest learning curve seeing as how I already know bits of Python and JS. I stopped coding sites before HTML 5 was released and I never picked it back up until now.

**App Ideas:** 
Used Toy Swap -- As kids outgrow their toys, allow people to take pictures and rate the stuff they want to get rid of. 
GUI Restaraunt Seating -- i.e. restaraunt seating app that uses a graphical layout to make reservations and reserve specific seating. Kind of like airplanes do.
Real Time Parking - The app will make use of GPS, location, webcams, and parking data to find a free parking space around you in real-time. This will be incredibly hard to do in real time.
Group Bills/Finance App - lets you add users (such as spouses, friends, roommates) to a "group" as well as bills that need to be paid. It will also allow due dates and amounts to be added and will keep track of each bill as users in the group pay them. 
Home Cleaning/Car Detailing - an app that allows you to "uber" someone quickly to clean your house or detail your car. User ratings will allow you to filter out who to use and who to avoid. Prices can be set based on ratings, for instance, if someone has a 1 star rating, they will not be able to charge outlandish prices. On the other hand, if someone has a 5 star rating, they'll have the option to request more money.
Odd Jobs/Quick Jobs App - an "uber" for trade workers. You place an "ad" for a job and the workers will be able to "bid" on your job that gives you a mean time to completion, cost, and consulting fee.
